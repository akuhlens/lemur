# Lemur

## Goal

Lemur is a compiler for a safe low-level systems programming language.
It is my attempt to learn the lean programming language, and start
down the path of my dreams of writing software that is quick and
robust.

## TODO

- [ ] Do lean tutorial
- [ ] Start with imp
- [ ] Compile imp Native
  - Start Reading list on Certified assembly
    - [Description of Vale's approach](https://project-everest.github.io/assets/vale2017.pdf)
- [ ] Extend lemur to language close to c-minor
- [ ] Extend lemur to have embedded seperation logic
